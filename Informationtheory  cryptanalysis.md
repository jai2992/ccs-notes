# Information Theory and Cryptanalysis

## Information Theory in Cryptography

### Key Concepts

- **Entropy**:

  - Measures the uncertainty or randomness in a system.
  - Higher entropy = more secure keys (harder to guess).
  - Example: A 128-bit key has higher entropy than an 8-bit key.

- **Redundancy**:

  - Refers to predictable patterns in data.
  - Cryptographic systems aim to minimize redundancy to make encrypted messages less predictable.

- **Perfect Secrecy**:
  - A system achieves perfect secrecy if the ciphertext reveals no information about the plaintext, even with infinite computational power.
  - Example: The **One-Time Pad** achieves perfect secrecy when used correctly.

## Product Cryptosystem

### Definition

- Combines two or more cryptographic algorithms to enhance security.
- Leverages the strengths of multiple algorithms to create a robust encryption mechanism.

### Examples

- **Double DES**: Encrypts plaintext with DES twice using two different keys.
- **Triple DES (3DES)**: Encrypts plaintext with DES three times using either two or three keys.

### Advantages

- Increased security: Harder for attackers to break.
- Flexibility: Can be tailored to specific security needs.

### Challenges

- Performance: Multiple encryption steps can slow down the system.
- Key management: More keys mean more complexity in secure storage and distribution.

## Cryptanalysis

### Definition

- The study of analyzing and breaking cryptographic systems.
- Involves finding weaknesses in encryption algorithms or implementations to decrypt ciphertext without knowing the key.

### Types of Cryptanalysis

#### 1. Ciphertext-only Attack (COA)

- **Scenario**: Attacker has access only to the ciphertext.
- **Goal**: Deduce the plaintext or the encryption key.
- **Example**: Breaking a Caesar cipher by trying all possible shifts.
- **Difficulty**: One of the hardest attacks due to minimal information.

#### 2. Known-plaintext Attack (KPA)

- **Scenario**: Attacker has access to some plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext.
- **Goal**: Use known pairs to deduce the encryption key or algorithm.
- **Example**: WWII cryptanalysts used weather reports to break the Enigma machine.
- **Difficulty**: Easier than COA due to more information.

#### 3. Chosen-plaintext Attack (CPA)

- **Scenario**: Attacker can choose plaintexts and obtain their corresponding ciphertexts.
- **Goal**: Analyze the encryption process to deduce the key.
- **Example**: Testing RSA security against CPA.
- **Difficulty**: Easier than KPA because the attacker controls the plaintext.

#### 4. Chosen-ciphertext Attack (CCA)

- **Scenario**: Attacker can choose ciphertexts and obtain their corresponding plaintexts.
- **Goal**: Analyze the decryption process to deduce the key.
- **Example**: Bleichenbacher attack on RSA padding schemes.
- **Difficulty**: Easier than CPA but requires access to the decryption mechanism.

#### 5. Side-channel Attack

- **Scenario**: Exploits physical information (e.g., timing, power consumption) leaked during encryption or decryption.
- **Goal**: Deduce the key or plaintext without directly attacking the algorithm.
- **Example**: Timing attacks on RSA exploit the time taken for modular exponentiation.
- **Difficulty**: Requires specialized equipment but can bypass strong cryptographic algorithms.
